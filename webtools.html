  <h1>Html</h1>
  <div>
    <p>
  Hypertext Markup Language, a standardized system for
  tagging text files to achieve font, color, graphic, and
  hyperlink effects on World Wide Web pages.
  <br>This is where you create your webpages at. We usually name these files as "index.html"</br>
    </p>
  </div>
  <h1>Css (Cascading Stylesheets)</h1>
  <div>
    <p>
     is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a
     document written in a markup language. So what this basically means is that Css is where you style your html file.
     Styling your Html file as a webpage is including arrangements of your layouts, coloring your layouts and fonts, font sizes, etc.
     Your Css is like the visual designer that you'll need for your html webpage.
     <br>We name these Css files "stylesheets.css" or "mainstyle.css" It's very important
     that you link these files to your html webpage in order for it to work.</br>
    </p>
  </div>
  <h1>javascript</h1>
  <div>
    <p>
    an object-oriented computer programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers.
    <br>This is a link to your html file where you can add is some pretty neat effects such as having "submit" click on buttons,
    alerts that ask you questions to submit your answers, and many more!
    </p>
  </div>
  <h1>SCSS (Sometime it's also known as "Sass")</h1>
  <div>
    <p>
  SCSS is a special type of file for SASS, a program written in Ruby that assembles CSS style sheets for a browser.
  <br>SASS adds lots of additional functionality to CSS like variables,</br>
  nesting and more which can make writing CSS easier and faster.
  In other words, this file is like Css but tends to make your designs and layouts in your webpages more easier to handle.
  It deals with having a lot of stylesheets such as having "main.css",
  "_base.scss", "_colors.scss", "_variables.scss", and "normalize.scss".
  <br>Most of your Web Design jobs highly recommend employees to have experience in SCSS because it's
  where you will have your Css stylesheets be more accessible to you when you design your websites and less time consuming to program.
